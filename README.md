- Flask-related: `flask`, `re`, `torch`, `torchvision`, `ultralytics`, `cv2`, `numpy`, `requests`, `openai`, `whisper`, `librosa`, `sklearn.feature_extraction.text`, `sklearn.metrics.pairwise`, `matplotlib`, `mpl_toolkits.mplot3d`

## Dataset Information
The SoccerSum dataset was curated by capturing and annotating soccer videos from the Norwegian Eliteserien league. This collection spans three years, covering 2021, 2022, and 2023. It comprises 750 frames from 41 unique sequences, with 4 to 40 frames per sequence, carefully chosen to represent a diverse selection of scenarios encountered in professional soccer games.
- **Storage**: [SoccerSum dataset on Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/10612084)

## Hardware Requirements
- **System Tested On**: Linux
- **GPU Requirement**: At least 1 GPU with 4 GB VRAM

## Installation and Experimentation

### Setup
1. Clone the SoccerSum repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/simula/SoccerSum
   ```

2. Install the necessary requirements:
   ```
   cd SoccerSum
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download the model weights for Detection, Segmentation, and Classification:
   - [SoccerSum HuggingFace repository](https://huggingface.co/SimulaMet-HOST/SoccerSum)

4. Place the weights in the `weights` folder. Adjust paths in `main.py`.

### Running the Application
1. Ensure port 5000 is free on your machine.

2. Start the Flask application:
   ```
   python3 app.py
   ```

3. The GUI will open in your default web browser.

### Usage
- Provide the path to a Goal event file (MP4 or M3U8 URL).
- A valid OPENAI API Access Token for GPT-4 is required.
- The system processes a 30-second clip in about 1 minute; longer clips take more time.
- Progress is shown on the GUI sidebar.
